# guess-number-rust
A small program made in Rust that **makes the player guess a random number**. 
The program has 4 levels, depending on the width of the random value ranges.
- 1 : from 1 to 500
- 2 : from 1 to 1000
- 3 : from 1 to 5000
- 4 : from 1 to 10000

> **Note** : As a first Rust project, the goal here is to exploit as many different concepts 
as possible (*borrowing, loops, enum, pattern matching, Result, etc.*) even if it 
means sometimes making the code a little more convoluted.
